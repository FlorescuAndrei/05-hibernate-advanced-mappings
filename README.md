# 05-hibernate-advanced-mappings
Hibernate learning project.  
CRUD and Advanced Mappings: One To One, One To Many,  Many To Many, Uni and Bidirectional.

Step 1: Basic CRUD operation on a single table (student)  
!Keep in mind:  
  - PK 
  - Autoincrement

Step 2: Hibernate advanced mapping (multiple tables)  
  - One to One : unidirectional/bidirectional relation:  
  tables: instuctor, instructor_detail  
  !Keep in mind:  
      - FK 
      - Cascade operations
  - One to Many	bidirectional:  
  tables: instructor, course  
  !Keep in mind:  
      - Fetch type: Eager vs Lazy 

  - One to Many  unidirectional:  
  tables: course, review  
  !Keep in mind:  
      - @JoinColumn place in Course instead of Review

  - Many to Many:  
  tables: course, student  
  !Keep in mind:  
      - @JoinTable
